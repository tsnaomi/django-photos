More tests coming soon!

- [Django-InplaceEdit](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-inplaceedit) is a really cool forms package (installed here as an app) that enables users to inline edit and auto-save database information (e.g., text and Boolean fields).

- Special thanks to [Mark Charyk](github.com/markcharyk) for guiding me with my urls.py and permissions, and to [Justin Lee](github.com/risingmoon) for patiently walking through deployment with me. Seriously, these guys are *awesome* devs.
